# Springboard 

Works for my Springboard Data Science Career Track, with a concentration with Advanced Machine Learning. The curriculum contains over 500 hours of hands-on materials while working with established industry experts, and the completion of two in-depth capstone projects.

The below list shows the projects I finished during the course, including my two capstone projects: 1) Good Book Classification; and 2) Facial Keypoints Detection Project.
